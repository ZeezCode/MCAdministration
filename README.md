# MCAdministration
An administration plugin for Minecraft servers

This system is half ingame and half web based, in that there'll be a web port where the staff can do a lot with the system. (Manage bans/warns/etc, view a player's record, etc.)

Update: I'm basically done the plugin half of this system, only adding small commands as I see fit while I brainstorm a good way to verify account ownership for when I make the web port
