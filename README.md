# MCAdministration
An administration plugin for Minecraft servers

This system is half ingame and half web based, in that there'll be a web port where the staff can do a lot with the system. (Manage bans/warns/etc, view a player's record, etc.)

Update: All primary functionality of plugin is complete. I have an idea for a small command to add but it's not a priority.
